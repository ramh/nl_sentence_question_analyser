This file contains instructions to run the ruby code that we have written for implementing our algorithm for NL assignment 1

The basic setup instructions are provided in the report - NL_assignment1.pdf file submitted.

The program can be run for training on a sentence and for parsing a sentence on a trained model.

1. Create an empty file 'trained_model.txt' on the same directory where the program is run

2. To Train on a sentence, usage: 
          ruby question_word_annotator.rb train "John gave a pen to Mary"

3. To Parse a sentence based on the trained data, usage:
          ruby question_word_annotator.rb parse "John gave a pen to Mary"
